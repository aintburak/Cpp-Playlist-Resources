# Stateless vs. Stateful Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions are a feature in programming languages that allow you to define and use anonymous functions or function-like constructs. These lambda expressions can be used in various contexts, and the terms "stateless" and "stateful" are often used to describe how functions behave within a given context.

## Stateless Lambda Expressions

**Stateless** lambda expressions are those that do not rely on any shared or external state. Each invocation of the lambda function is independent and does not depend on previous invocations or any external data. Stateless lambda expressions are typically designed to be idempotent, meaning that the result of an invocation depends solely on the input parameters provided, and there is no internal state maintained between invocations.

In a stateless Lambda function:

- It processes its input parameters and produces a result.
- It does not store information about previous invocations.
- It does not access external resources or databases to maintain or retrieve data.

Stateless Lambda functions are often used when you want to parallelize tasks, scale your application easily, or maintain a clean and simple architecture.



```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Stateless lambda function that adds two numbers
    auto add = [](int a, int b) { return a + b; };

    int result = add(5, 3);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl; // Output: Result: 8

    return 0;
}
```
In this C++ example, the lambda function add is stateless. It takes two integers as input parameters and returns their sum. It does not rely on any shared or external state.



## Stateful Lambda Expressions

**Stateful** lambda expressions, on the other hand, maintain some form of shared state between invocations. This means that the lambda function retains information or context from previous calls or relies on external resources to store and retrieve data.

In a stateful Lambda function:

- It can remember information from previous invocations, such as variable values or data stored in memory.
- It might access external resources, like databases, caches, or storage, to maintain and share state information between invocations.
- It can keep track of the application's context over time.

Stateful Lambda functions are useful when you need to maintain state information across multiple invocations, share data between function calls, or implement more complex application logic.

The choice between stateless and stateful design depends on the specific use case and requirements of your application. Stateless functions are often easier to manage, deploy, and scale, while stateful functions can be more complex but allow for maintaining context and shared data between invocations.



```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int total = 0;

    // Stateful lambda function that accumulates a running total
    auto accumulate = [&total](int value) {
        total += value;
        return total;
    };

    int result1 = accumulate(5);
    int result2 = accumulate(10);

    std::cout << "Result 1: " << result1 << std::endl; // Output: Result 1: 5
    std::cout << "Result 2: " << result2 << std::endl; // Output: Result 2: 15

    return 0;
}
```

In this C++ example, the lambda function accumulate is stateful. It captures a reference to the external variable total and uses it to accumulate a running total across invocations. The lambda function's behavior depends on the shared state, and changes to the total variable affect the function's output.

## To Sum up
So, it's important to design Lambda functions in a way that aligns with the needs of your application and the principles of serverless and distributed computing.
